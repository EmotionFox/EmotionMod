# Emotion's Mod
Emotion's Mod is a mod who add items, blocks, biomes, entities etc.. I gave a sort of second life. 

# What this mod want to do?
Concretely I'm adding stuff in symbiosis with the current game and make it deeper. It's really important to me to keep this "basic" aspect and to fit with the actual design.

# What about the futur update?
The next step is to bring the mod in 1.11.2 and add a custom dimension called Dreaming Land (I've allready work on it in 1.8 and there is not much to do anymore)

# Can I take your sources?
You can leach my class but all the textures remain private (just give a look if you want). Don't forget to mention me if you'r using a part of my work.
